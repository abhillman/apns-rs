Simple tool for sending APNS with rust.

```bash
cargo run -- 'something u want for notif title' 'notif subtitle' 'notif body'
```

Specify a `apns.toml` file like this to get rolling:

```
topic = "com.supercool.app"
apns_host = "api.sandbox.push.apple.com:443"

[apns]
auth_key_id = "..."
team_id = "..."
p8_contents = """
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
from your .p8 file that you downloaded from apple
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
"""

[development]
device_tokens = [
    "some device token"
]
```
